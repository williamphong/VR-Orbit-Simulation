# VR Orbit Simualation
An educational VR demo focusing on Earth's orbit and Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion. This project was created in C#, Unity, and developed for the CS490 Capstone Project. 

## Main features
- Mathematically correct orbits
  - Berger's Solution (1978) implemented to calculate Milankovitch paramters
    - Function of time (specific to a calendar date)
    - outputs eccentricity, obliquity, and longitude of perihelion
- Forward and Inverse Keplerian functions to determine Earth's position based on time and vice versa
- Seasonal day-length calculation
- Sun Declination and Solar Insolation (WIP)

## Definitions

This section will define common terms and phrases used throughout the project and research paper. Common variable names referring to the terms within the code will be written as (variable).

- Milankovitch cycles describe the changes in Earth's orbit over time and are defined in three variables
    - Eccentricity (eccen): How much the Earth's orbit deviates from a circle to an oval
    - Obliquity (obliq): The angle of Earth as it moves along the orbit
    - Longitude of perihelion (omega_bar): spatial angle from vernal equinox to perihelion in degrees with sun as angle vertex
 
- Kepler's equations describe Earth's position on an orbit in relation to the Milankovitch parameters
    - Forward Keplerian (keplerian): Provided an orbital period (in our case, 365.256363 days), eccentricity (eccen), and eccentric anomaly (true_anomaly), return the mean anomaly
      - Eccentric Anomaly:
      - Mean Anomaly:

    - Inverse Keplerian (inverse_keplerian): Provided eccentricity (eccen), mean anomaly (mean_anomaly), return the true anomaly
 
- Solar Declination: angle between the Sun’s rays and the plane of the Earth’s equator
- Solar Insolation: incoming solar radiation from the Sun at the top of Earth’s atmosphere (TOA) measured by Watt/square meter (Fo)


## Documentation
This section contains a brief overview of the scripts written in this project.

### bergers.cs

This file uses Berger's solution to calculate the three Milankovitch parameters as a function of YEAR. 

Berger's solution utilizes three different arrays (tables from Berger) containing obliquity, eccentricity, and precession values based on the year provided.

Obliquity and precession values are returned in degrees, and eccentricity is returned as a double (dimensionless).

### keplerian.cs

This file contains functions solving the forward and inverse Keplerian functions. 

The forward Keplerian function returns the time since the last perihelion passage and mean anomaly.

The inverse Keplerian function returns the true anomaly.

### seasons.cs

Calculates the day lengths of winter, spring, summer, and fall seasons of the year.

Utilizes the forward Keplerian function to find the day lengths of each season, with precession determining the formulas.

### generate_rot.cs

Helper function utilized in orbit.cs to find radius vectors

### orbit.cs

This file utilizes the previous files to generate orbital data. OrbitCalc returns solar declination, solar insolation, season day lengths, radius vector length from the sun to Earth, hour length of the day, and true anomaly.
